# Cryptography-Implementation
 This repository is meant to to store the implementations of various cryptographic schemes I plan to study during my Arch away semester. These algorithms will be taken from "An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography, 2nd ed." by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman. Likewise, the implementation will be done in C. Finally, a basic description of the algorithms will be provided in the wiki.
